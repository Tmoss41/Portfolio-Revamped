        <h1> About</h1>
        <article>
            <p>Born in 2000, I have always loved, design, technology, and moving dynamic structures. 
            Whilst working as a medical software technician and after some time being a high level support tech, i decided it was time to pursue a career where all
            of these were present, hence, I am now working towards becoming a web-developer.</p>
            
            <p>HTML and CSS were all learnt in school, and some online classes gave me the basics in the Python programming language. To flesh out my coding knowledge, I am undertaking a 
            6 month bootcamp. So far I am two thirds of the way through, and so far, I have brushed up on my HTML and CSS coding skills, learnt how to utilise SASS, learnt how to program in Ruby and how to create web applications in its gem Ruby on Rails.  </p>

            <p> Node, Javascript and React are up to conquer. </p>
